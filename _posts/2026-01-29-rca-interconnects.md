## Key Features to Consider:

- **Conductor Material**: Oxygen-free copper (OFC) provides low resistance and clarity, long-grain copper reduces distortion, silver-plated enhances high frequencies
- **Shielding Quality**: Single braid adequate for short runs, double-shield (braid + foil) rejects interference, quad designs for extreme EMI/RFI environments
- **Connector Plating**: Gold-plating resists corrosion and improves conductivity, rhodium offers premium oxidation resistance, silver maximizes signal transfer
- **Cable Geometry**: Coaxial design standard for subwoofers (75-ohm), twisted-pair suits line-level stereo, balanced geometry reduces crosstalk between channels
- **Length Requirements**: Shorter cables minimize signal degradation, keep runs under 6ft when possible, use active boosters beyond 25ft for critical listening
- **Impedance Matching**: Line-level interconnects use standard impedance, subwoofer cables require 75-ohm coaxial for proper bass signal transmission
- **Budget vs Performance**: Diminishing returns above $50/meter for most systems, premium cables benefit high-end components with resolving speakers

All prices are approximate and may vary based on sales and availability.
