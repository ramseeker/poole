The child is getting a bit old for this, but it still gets played with from time to time and maybe, just maybe, it might be a little bit educational. I think there's a few games she can play and she knows how to prank her Dad and set an alarm for the middle of the night and then stuff the watch under her bed.

Maybe I should make this disappear for this reason alone.
