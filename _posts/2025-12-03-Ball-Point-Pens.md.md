I'm not a pen snob so maybe I'm the wrong person to give advice for pen replacements, but I have heard that getting into pens can get crazy expensive.

I know there's reddit groups and clubs all about pens and I'm not that guy as  I don't really have much use for a pen and theres always a pen or two in my [[Glass Pen Holder]] so I  haven't had to buy a pen in a long time so these would do in a pinch. 

The only other writing tools I may need would be some [[Pencils]] and maybe [[Sharpie]] or two and I am good to go.
