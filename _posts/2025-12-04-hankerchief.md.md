I really don't know why one would need a handkerchief unless it was to tuck in a breast pocket on a men's suit.

It seems pretty gross to me  to  have to use a handkerchief in 2025 when you have a more palatable option of [[2025-12-03-facial-tissue.md|facial tissues]] because somehow the idea of walking around with a pocket full of boogers isn't my idea of a good time. 

I wonder if there's a handkerchief reddit group - I'm not going to look - where you can discuss the pros and cons of booger retrieval with handkerchief vs tissues

I would guess there would be.
