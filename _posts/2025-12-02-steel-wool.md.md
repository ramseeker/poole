I only remember using steel wool for cleaning the rust off my bike tires and I doubt I would use it to clean my [[2025-12-02-pots-pans.md]] for daily use as there are more gentle [[2025-12-02-kitchen-sponge.md|ways]] to clean your dishes now.

### Jim's Pick
> [Amazon.com: Scotch-Brite Stainless Steel Scrubbers, Scouring Pads for Cleaning Tough Baked-On Messes, Metal Scrubbers for Cleaning Dishes, 3 Scrub Pads : Health & Household](https://amzn.to/48hFQLn)

I like these over tradition steel wool pads because they don't have that messy soap built into them already and it's so, so messy and I have yet to determine if it actually makes a difference so I have to pick the above as my recommendation and just get a bit of your own [[2025-12-03-dish-soap.md|dish soap]] to use with these pads and I bet you're rocking it just as well than those others.
