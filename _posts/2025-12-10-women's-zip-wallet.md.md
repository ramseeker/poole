I hate zippered wallets, as to me they seem like another step to have to do at the counter when you need to pay so I don't really understand the need, just like I have no reason to buy a [wallet phone case](https://amzn.to/4aHmlxa) as that seems like a bad idea too. 

That said, here's the wallet I would buy: 

**Jim's Pick for a Women's Zippered Wallet**
[Michael Kors Women's Jet Set Double Zip Wristlet, Gold-Tone Hardware/Soft Pink: Handbags: Amazon.com](https://amzn.to/3MEFupD)

This wallet by Michael Kors looks to be a lot nicer than the weirdly-named off brand wallets you can buy and it seems to hold all things you would need such as a phone and cards and ID so I don't know what else you would need from a small wallet for women. 

**Pros:** Excellent quality and well worth the price

**Cons:** The phone slot could be a bit too tight for larger phones

**Rating:** 4.7 out of 5

**Alternative Choice**

Despite the weird name, the Travelambo Women's wallet is a fraction of the price and is a good choice for those budget minded.
