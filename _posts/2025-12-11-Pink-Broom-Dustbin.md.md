I was not sold on this broom when we got it - not because it's pink but because I thought the bristles were a bit stiff compared to my previous broom set. 

It turns out I was wrong.

After using this  broom for a few days, you get used to it - like anything else - and for the money I paid for this broom and dustpan set, it's fine. 

**Jim's Pick for Pink Broom and Dustpan**

[Amazon.com: kelamayi Broom and Dustpan Set for Home, Office, Indoor&Outdoor Sweeping, Stand Up Broom and Dustpan (Pink) : Health & Household](https://amzn.to/4jbGNZD)

I like this one due to the stuff brushes and the dustpan itself has some bristles that you can use to make sure all the dog hair stays in the pan and doesn't just get moved around the bristles of the broom. 

**Pros**: Well made and the pet hair teeth are great

**Cons**: the handle keeps coming unscrewed

**Rating**: 4.4 out of five

**Alternative Option**:

This broom and dustpan set is cheaper by about ten bucks and looks to be pretty much the same.
