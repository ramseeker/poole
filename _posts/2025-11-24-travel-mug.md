You would think with all this technology available to is we would be able to design a coffee mug that doesn't spill. 
I didn't know I was a coffee cup snob until I was constantly spilling on myself and so I went and did some reading and found that the Contigo cups were pretty good. 

I like the fact that you can flip a tab and the opening will close quickly as you don't have to worry about spilling. 
I would and definitely have recommend this coffee travel mug.
