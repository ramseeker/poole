## Key Features to Consider:

- **Power Output Requirements**: 32-ohm headphones need 100-500mW, 250-300 ohm models require 500-1000mW, planar magnetics demand 1-3W for proper driving
- **Balanced vs Single-Ended**: Balanced connections (XLR, 4.4mm) provide double voltage swing and channel separation, single-ended (3.5mm, 6.35mm) suits most headphones
- **DAC Integration**: Combo units simplify setup with USB input, separate components allow upgrading DAC and amp independently for flexibility
- **Tube vs Solid-State**: Tubes offer warm euphonic coloration with even harmonics, solid-state delivers neutral transparent amplification with lower distortion
- **Gain Settings**: Low gain for sensitive IEMs (95+ dB/mW), medium for standard headphones, high gain drives high-impedance models (250-600 ohm)
- **Input/Output Options**: Desktop amps need RCA/XLR inputs for DAC connection, multiple outputs enable speaker and headphone switching simultaneously
- **Portability Considerations**: Pocket DAC/amps run 8-20 hours on battery, desktop units require AC power but deliver superior performance and features
