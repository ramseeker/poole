## Key Features to Consider:

- **Temperature Rating**: -10°F adequate for mild winters, -25°F for cold climates, -40°F for extreme conditions, consider activity level
- **Insulation Amount**: 100g light for active kids, 200g standard winter warmth, 400g+ for extreme cold or standing activities
- **Waterproof vs Water-Resistant**: Fully waterproof essential for deep snow, water-resistant sufficient for light snow and slush
- **Closure Type**: Pull-on fastest for toddlers, hook-and-loop easy for young kids, laces with toggles best for older children
- **Traction Outsole**: Deep lugs prevent slipping on ice, rubber compounds stay flexible in cold, avoid smooth soles on snow
- **Size Guidance**: Order half size up for thick socks, allow 1/2" growing room, measure both feet as kids' feet grow rapidly
- **Easy Care**: Removable liners enable washing, synthetic materials dry faster than leather, machine washable options ideal for toddlers
