I know some of you are all about keyboards and there's reddit groups about all the different keyboards to try and you can get into keycaps and switches and colors etc.

I've tried to like mechanical keyobards but I keep on going back to a basic chicket keyboard and I landed on this keyboard from KeyChron and it's fine. 

It's both Bluetooth and 2.4ghz and I use the latter all the time because it's more efficient and I find bluetooth does not always connect as it should
