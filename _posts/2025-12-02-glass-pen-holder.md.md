I have no idea where I got this, but I've  had it for years and it's survived more than one move, which is more than I can say about all the other stuff. 

It's hard to find a sturdy holder for your [[pens]] and [[scissors]] and [[highlighters]] that does not topple over at the the first glance of a bump on the desk or something like that. 

### Jim's Pick:
> 
[Amazon.com : Officepal Pen Holder for Desk, Ceramic Pencil Organizer & Makeup Brush Holder, Office Decor and Desk Accessories，Perfect Office Organization,Teacher Supplies (White, Set / 1) : Office Products](https://amzn.to/44dnXL7)

This one wins because it's relatively cheap and is not as flimsy as the other pen holders available. It's only about 10 bucks too. [check price](https://amzn.to/44dnXL7)

If it came down to it, I would choose the Ceramic Model as my replacement for my glass one. The glass one has survived the years but I think the ceramic is one I want to use as my every day if I had to do it all over.
