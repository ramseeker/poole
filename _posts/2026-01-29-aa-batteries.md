## Key Features to Consider:

- **Rechargeable vs Disposable**: Rechargeable NiMH save money after 3-5 uses but cost more upfront, alkaline cheaper initially for occasional use
- **Capacity Ratings**: 2000-2100mAh standard rechargeable, 2500-2800mAh high-capacity for cameras, alkaline measured in mAh varies by brand
- **Self-Discharge**: Low self-discharge (LSD) rechargeables retain 70-80% charge after years, standard NiMH lose 30% per month when stored
- **Shelf Life**: Alkaline and lithium last 10-20 years in storage, rechargeable NiMH best used within 1-2 years for optimal performance
- **Temperature Performance**: Lithium operates in extreme cold/heat (-40°F to 140°F), alkaline works 0-130°F, NiMH 32-104°F optimal range
- **Recharge Cycles**: Standard NiMH 500-1,000 cycles, Eneloop 2,100 cycles, lithium-ion rechargeable 1,000+ cycles but more expensive
- **Voltage Stability**: Alkaline starts 1.5V declining to 1.0V, NiMH steady 1.2V throughout discharge, lithium maintains 1.5V until depleted

All prices are approximate and may vary based on sales and availability.
