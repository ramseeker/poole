I would be rich if I didn't have to buy mittens for the child. This, and [[2025-12-03-kids-winter-hat.md|winter hats]] disappear at an alarming rate. 

With this knowledge I suggest that you buy the cheapest winter mittens or gloves you can find. 
## Jim's Pick

I like these because they're cheap enough and you get 3 pairs for about 5 bucks which isn't bad at all for kids mittens. You could buy more expensive mittens but why would you when they either get lost or eaten by the Dog?

You could go the route of clips or strings to keep the mittens somehow attatched to the child, but I found they didn't really work that well and they still got lost.
