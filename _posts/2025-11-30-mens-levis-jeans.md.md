Jeans are the quintessential wardrobe item for myself. I have tried to wear many other pants over the years and always come back to jeans.

Now, especially because now they're not just plain denim but also some kind of space age stretchy material for those of us with variable waistlines.

I suggest waiting for them to go on sale as they tend to frequently because who wants to pay full price for a pair of jeans?
