Where we live, winter boots are necessity regardless of age. Well, unless you're a teen and  then you just wear your Nike's year round. 

![This is the first snow this year here in St. Louis.  It has snowed overnight and I was eager to step outside.  The air was crisp and as I was walking into the snow it felt like walking on fluffy cotton balls.  The snow was still coming down softly and it was truly a winter wonderland.](https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1542336945-a4b0d29304c5?crop=entropy&cs=tinysrgb&fit=max&fm=jpg&ixid=M3wzNjAwOTd8MHwxfHNlYXJjaHwxfHx3aW50ZXIlMjBib290fGVufDB8MHx8fDE3NjUwNTY2MzR8MA&ixlib=rb-4.1.0&q=80&w=1080)

We've tried to use some Ugg Boots for the child because they are cute, but nobody really cares what a six-year-old years so this year we cheaped out and got the boots that she picked out. 

**Jim's Pick for Kid's Winter Boots**

[Amazon.com \| Lands' End Waterproof Kids Snow Boots - Insulated Warm Fleece Lined Winter Boots for Toddlers, Girls & Boys - Cotton Candy Pink, 10 Toddler \| Boots](https://amzn.to/48r0LvG)

These ended up being a pretty good buy at about $40 on sale and we like them. 

**Pros**: Well made, comfortable and easy to put on and off. Waterproof helps too. 

**Cons**: There's a chance of premature wear but kids wear through stuff at such a rate it's not like these will be family heirlooms. 

**Rating**: 4/3 out of Five Stars.

There's probably better boots but these are name brand winter boots for kids that are easy to get into and out of, are waterproof and priced usually about $40.00 on sale.
