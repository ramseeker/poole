## Key Features to Consider:

- **Material Selection**: Stainless steel resists bacteria and is most durable, ceramic offers weight and style, while plastic is lightweight and affordable but may harbor bacteria over time
- **Size Appropriateness**: Choose bowl capacity based on dog size - small dogs need 1-2 cups, medium dogs 2-4 cups, and large breeds 4-8 cups per meal
- **Elevated vs. Floor Level**: Raised bowls can reduce neck strain for large breeds and senior dogs, while floor-level works well for most dogs and prevents gulping
- **Slow Feeder Benefits**: Puzzle and maze designs slow eating speed, reducing bloat risk and improving digestion, especially important for fast eaters
- **Non-Slip Features**: Rubber bases or silicone mats prevent bowl sliding and protect floors from scratches and water damage
- **Temperature Control**: Insulated bowls maintain water temperature while heated options provide fresh water in freezing climates
- **Easy Cleaning**: Dishwasher-safe materials save time and ensure proper sanitation between meals
