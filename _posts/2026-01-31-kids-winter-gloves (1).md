## Key Features to Consider:

- **Gloves vs Mittens**: Mittens warmer as fingers share heat, gloves allow better dexterity, convertible designs offer both benefits
- **Waterproof Membranes**: Gore-Tex premium breathable waterproof, proprietary inserts adequate for snow play, none okay for dry cold
- **Insulation Weight**: 40g Thinsulate standard warmth, 60-100g for very cold, 150g+ for extreme conditions or less active kids
- **Sizing Guidance**: Measure hand circumference at widest point, allow room for growth but not too loose, check brand size charts
- **Stay-On Features**: Long cuffs tuck into jacket sleeves, elastic/velcro wrist straps secure fit, jacket clips prevent loss
- **Grip Enhancement**: Textured PVC palms help hold sleds and snowballs, silicone dots improve grip, reinforced areas increase durability
- **Age Considerations**: Mittens easier for toddlers to put on, gloves better for kids 5+, scratch mittens for infants prevent face scratching
