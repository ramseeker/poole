But, the kiddo loves them more than her [[2025-11-22-we-fed-the-sea-monkeys.md|sea monkeys]] so there's that. 

I must warn you that if you're buying these for your child that they will be clean for all of about 7 seconds. But the good news is that they seem to be washable for the most part and the lights still work after. 

Maybe I got lucky with the washing, I dunno but you only get a few month out of these anyway and you can usually find them on sale for about $25 so whatever. 

These are great shoes because the child can put them on themselves due to the elastic laces and velcro. I recommend these. 


There are other designs and colors if you don't like my pick, but the skechers are a good brand name sneaker for little growing feet.
