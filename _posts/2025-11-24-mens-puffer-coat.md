I really don't care much for what winter coat I have as my current lifestyle is to go from house to car most days and **maybe** have to stand around and wait for the school bus with my daughter in the am.

I have the Amazon essentials puffer jacket and one of the better features of this jacket is that it is cheap and is often on sale for $20 or so which in 2025 is a great price for a jacket of any kind.

There's other jackets you could buy and some are from brands you recognize and then some are from brands you don't but they are all the same fairly well so just pick one. I like the Amazon one I list above, but if that's not your bag, then there's others to choose from.
