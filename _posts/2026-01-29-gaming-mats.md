## Key Features to Consider:

- **Surface Material Types**: Cloth provides control with comfortable wrist rest, hard surfaces enable faster mouse movements, hybrid options balance both characteristics
- **Size Selection**: Standard (12x10") suits tight desks, extended (36x18") fits keyboard and mouse, XXL (48x24") covers entire desk surface
- **Thickness Impact**: Thin 2mm mats lay flat easily, 3-4mm offers cushioning and stability, 6mm+ provides premium wrist comfort and durability
- **Edge Stitching**: Anti-fray stitched edges prevent peeling and extend lifespan 3-5 years, unstitched edges deteriorate faster with heavy use
- **Base Grip**: Rubber or silicone bases prevent sliding during intense gaming, textured patterns enhance grip on various desk surfaces
- **RGB Lighting**: Customizable zones sync with ecosystem (Razer Chroma, Corsair iCUE), standalone modes for non-compatible setups
- **Cleaning Maintenance**: Cloth mats machine washable or spot-clean, hard surfaces wipe clean easily, coated options resist spills and stains
