## Key Features to Consider:

- **Cable Length Planning**: 3-6ft for rack patching, 10-15ft for studio vocal booth, 25-50ft for live stage performances, 100ft+ for outdoor festivals
- **Conductor Quality**: Oxygen-free copper (OFC) reduces signal degradation, multi-gauge networks improve frequency response, pure copper core maximizes clarity
- **Shielding Types**: 90-95% spiral shield suits most applications, 100% foil + braid provides maximum RF/EMI rejection for noisy environments
- **Connector Grade**: Neutrik XX series industry standard for durability, gold-plated contacts resist corrosion, metal housings outlast plastic alternatives
- **Balanced Signal**: XLR carries balanced audio rejecting interference over long runs, essential for professional microphones and line-level connections
- **Cable Jacket**: PVC flexible and affordable, rubber more durable for touring, braided fabric reduces tangling and stage noise
