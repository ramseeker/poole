I used to just use the good old [j-cloths](https://amzn.to/4pKMpf5) that I had been using since oh, the eighties at least.

But now, I have better. Because there's now some cloths that work better than the old dish washing cloths of yesterday. 

The problem with the older dish washing cloths of yesterday is that they smelled a lot if you didn't stay on top of them. The musty smell is one smell I could never get used to, and besides - who wants to wash dishes with an older musty dish cloth that's a germ factory in fabric farm.

these are great for washing my [travel mug](http://jims.one/2025/11/24/travel-mug/) for one example as they are very absorbant to get all the old coffee out and have it rinsed and ready for next time.
