## Key Features to Consider:

- **Material Selection**: Metal rulers most durable and precise for technical drawing, plastic flexible and shatter-resistant for students, wood traditional and economical
- **Measurement Systems**: Dual-scale rulers show both imperial (inches) and metric (cm/mm), single-scale adequate if only using one system
- **Edge Type**: Beveled edges for inking prevent smudging, straight edges suit general measuring, cork backing prevents slipping during use
- **Length Requirements**: 6" pocket rulers for portability, 12" standard for most tasks, 18-36" for architectural and engineering work
- **Marking Precision**: Photo-etched or laser-etched markings won't fade, printed scales may wear with heavy use, clear visibility essential
- **Flexibility**: Rigid metal maintains accuracy under pressure, flexible plastic bends around curves, shatterproof options survive drops
- **Special Features**: Finger lift holes aid pickup, hanging holes for storage, conversion tables printed for quick reference
