## Key Features to Consider:

- **Insulation Rating**: 100-200g mild winters and active use, 400g moderate cold and snow, 600-1000g extreme cold or standing activities
- **Waterproof Technology**: Sealed seams essential for deep snow, waterproof membranes (Gore-Tex) breathable, rubber boots 100% waterproof but less breathable
- **Height Options**: Ankle boots (6-8") everyday versatility, mid-calf (10-12") snow protection, tall boots (14"+) deep snow and extreme cold
- **Temperature Rating**: -10°F to -25°F typical winter boots, -40°F for severe cold, -60°F extreme conditions, consider wind chill factor
- **Traction Soles**: Deep lugs prevent slipping on snow, rubber compounds stay flexible in cold, specialized winter grips for ice
- **Weight Considerations**: Lightweight boots (2-3 lbs) for walking and activity, heavy boots (4-6 lbs) maximum insulation and durability
- **Sizing Tips**: Order half size up for thick socks, ensure toe room when flexed, break in leather boots before winter, women's sizes run smaller
