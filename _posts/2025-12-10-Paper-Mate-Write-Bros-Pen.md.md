We have a lot of pens here in the house but if I had to replace them all it might be this one that gets the nod:

These little pens are not a piece of crap like a lot of other pens you can buy. Sure, they are not the cheapest pen you can buy in 2025 but they're close and if my daughter would stay out of our junk drawer we might even have one when I went looking for a pen. 

**Pros:** A writing experience comparable to pricier options

**Cons:** Easy to lose the cap. Pen is not a clicky pen

**Rating:** 4.6 out of 5

**Another Alternative:**

These are the cheap blue ball point pens we know and love so if you don't need fancy feeling pen and just want a pen that works then these might be the choice for you.
