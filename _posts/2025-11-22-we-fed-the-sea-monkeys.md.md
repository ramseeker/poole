We fed the sea monkeys  today and it was okay for us and a little fun and I can't believe that the sea monkeys are actually growing. I thought she was going to jump out of her [[2025-11-24-kid-schechers-shoes-with-lights.md|shoes]] when she saw the first monkey swimming in the water. 

These are a fun little thing and seem to be age appropriate too. 

Here's a few sea monkeys you can buy if you would like to buy them from Amazon:
