## Key Features to Consider:

- **Thunderbolt Generation**: TB4 offers 40Gbps + USB4 compatibility + mandatory dual 4K support, TB3 provides 40Gbps with varied features depending on dock
- **Power Delivery Wattage**: 60W charges ultrabooks, 85-90W suits most laptops, 96-100W required for MacBook Pro 16" and gaming laptops at full performance
- **Display Configuration**: Verify exact monitor setup support (single 8K, dual 4K@60Hz, triple 4K via daisy-chain or MST hub)
- **Port Selection**: Count needed USB-A (legacy peripherals), USB-C (modern devices), SD readers (photography), Ethernet (stability), audio (headsets)
- **Certification Matters**: Intel Thunderbolt certified ensures full 40Gbps speeds, compatibility with all TB devices, and proper display protocol support
- **Form Factor**: Desktop docks offer maximum ports and stability, portable models prioritize travel convenience with fewer connections
- **Future-Proofing**: Thunderbolt 4 mandatory features (dual 4K, USB4, wake from sleep) make it better investment than Thunderbolt 3 for long-term use
