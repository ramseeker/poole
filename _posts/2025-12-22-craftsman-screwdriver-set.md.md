You need a few things in life, like a good barber or mechanic and if you need to do anything around the house or even assemble that new TV you bought - you need a good screwdriver set. 

Take a look at craftsman screwdrivers:

Let me say this right off the bat: Do not cheap out on screwdrivers. This doesn't mean you need to buy the most expensive tools out there but there's time to buy a good brand name and this is one of those times. Don't cheap out and the crap from the dollar store. 

**Jim's Pick for a good screwdriver set.** 

[Amazon.com: CRAFTSMAN Screwdriver Set, Assorted, 12Piece (CMHT65044) : Tools & Home Improvement](https://amzn.to/49oIlff)

**Pros**: Cheap! About $25 gets you all the screwdrivers you will need for everyday tasks

**Cons**: The flathead might break on you, but it's very rare. 

**Rating**: 4.8 out of 5

**Alternative:**
If the Craftsman I suggested above doesn't do it for you, then here's my second choice. 

[Amazon.com: CARTMAN Magnetic Screwdriver Set with Rack, Includs Precision Screwdriver, Magnetizer Demagnetizer and Magnetic Bowl, DIY Tools for Men : Tools & Home Improvement](https://amzn.to/4avEzBR)
 
This screwdriver kit has a **lot more** in it for not much more money at about 30 bucks. If you need a more advanced screwdriver set then this might be a good choice.
