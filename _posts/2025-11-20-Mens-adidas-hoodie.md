<a href="{{ page.link }}"> This is my favorite hoodie</a>

I have fallen when it comes to fashion. At [[2025-11-22-glass-pen-holder]] time it was all about the look and now comfort trumps all and I live in a hoodie almost all the time now.

All you really need is a clean hoodie a white t-shirt underneath and some comfortable shoes and you're ready to go. 

I'm kind of allergic to logos, but the Adidas stuff is well made for the most part so that's why I would buy this one over others, but there's a few other options to consider when buying the best hooded sweatshirt for your wardrobe
