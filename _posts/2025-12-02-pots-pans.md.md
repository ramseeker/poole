I really don't care much about pots and pans. I mean, they work and that's about it.

Actually, scratch that. Pots and pans **do matter** because if you eat at home (you should) then you will spend a lot of time cooking and liek th mechanics that pay a lot of money for good tools, every home should have a good pot and pan set.

You don't have to spend a lot of money on a pot and pan set, although you can, it's optional and if you start with a good starter set it will let you figure out what pots and pans you use the most so when the next time you need a new pot and pan set you have a better day about your needs.
