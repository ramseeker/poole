## Key Features to Consider:

- **Data Speed Requirements**: USB 2.0 (480Mbps) adequate for charging, USB 3.2 Gen 2 (10Gbps) for external SSDs, Thunderbolt 4 (40Gbps) for pro workflows
- **Power Delivery Ratings**: 60W suits phones and tablets, 100W required for laptops, E-Marker chips ensure safe high-wattage charging
- **Video Capabilities**: DP Alt Mode enables 4K@60Hz over USB-C, 8K requires USB 3.2 Gen 2, Thunderbolt 4 supports dual 4K displays
- **Cable Length Impact**: Under 3ft maintains USB 3.2 10Gbps speeds, 6ft adequate for most setups, beyond 10ft requires active cables for high speeds
- **Build Quality**: Braided nylon resists tangling and abrasion, aluminum connectors dissipate heat, strain relief prevents cable failure at connectors
- **Thunderbolt vs USB-C**: Thunderbolt 4 backward compatible with USB-C but offers 4x speed and daisy-chaining, not all USB-C cables support Thunderbolt speeds
- **Certification Matters**: Intel Thunderbolt certified ensures full 40Gbps, USB-IF certification guarantees spec compliance, E-Marker chips required for 5A/100W charging
