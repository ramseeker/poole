## Key Features to Consider:

- **Port Requirements**: Inventory needed connections (HDMI, USB-A, SD, Ethernet) before purchase to avoid multiple dongles cluttering workspace
- **Power Delivery Pass-Through**: 85-100W PD ensures laptop charges while using hub, essential for sustained productivity without battery drain
- **Video Output Specs**: 4K@30Hz adequate for basic displays, 4K@60Hz for smooth scrolling, 4K@120Hz or 8K for gaming and pro workflows
- **Data Transfer Speeds**: USB 3.0 (5Gbps) handles most tasks, USB 3.1 Gen 2 (10Gbps) benefits external SSDs, Thunderbolt 3 (40Gbps) for pro storage
- **Build Quality**: Aluminum construction dissipates heat better than plastic, preventing throttling during intensive file transfers and video output
- **Size & Portability**: Compact single-port adapters ideal for travel, multi-port hubs better for permanent desk setups with comprehensive connectivity
- **Compatibility Verification**: Ensure hub supports your device (Mac, Windows, Chromebook) and required features (Thunderbolt 3/4, DisplayPort Alt Mode)
