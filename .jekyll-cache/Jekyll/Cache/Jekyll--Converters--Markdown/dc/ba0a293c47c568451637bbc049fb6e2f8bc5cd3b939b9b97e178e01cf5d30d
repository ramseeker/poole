I"ä<p>I really donâ€™t know why one would need a handkerchief unless it was to tuck in a breast pocket on a menâ€™s suit.</p>

<p>It seems pretty gross to me  to  have to use a handkerchief in 2025 when you have a more palatable option of <a class="wiki-link" href="/facial-tissue">facial tissues</a> because somehow the idea of walking around with a pocket full of boogers isnâ€™t my idea of a good time.</p>

<p>I wonder if thereâ€™s a handkerchief reddit group - Iâ€™m not going to look - where you can discuss the pros and cons of booger retrieval with handkerchief vs tissues</p>

<p>I would guess there would be.</p>
