<p>Jeans are the quintessential wardrobe item for myself. I have tried to wear many other pants over the years and always come back to jeans.</p>

<p>Now, especially because now they’re not just plain denim but also some kind of space age stretchy material for those of us with variable waistlines.</p>

<p>I stick to the basic colors and for style, I like the slim fit for my once slim fit, but if I keep eating pie I might have to graduate to relaxed</p>

<p>I suggest waiting for them to go on sale as they tend to frequently because who wants to pay full price for a pair of jeans?</p>
