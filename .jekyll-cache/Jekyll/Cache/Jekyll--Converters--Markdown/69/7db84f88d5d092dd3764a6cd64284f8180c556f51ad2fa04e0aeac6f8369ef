<p>Iâ€™m not a pen snob so maybe Iâ€™m the wrong person to give advice for pen replacements, but I have heard that getting into pens can get crazy expensive.</p>

  <p>Cheap pens are great because, well - theyâ€™re cheap and if you lose them itâ€™s no big deal.</p>

<p>I know thereâ€™s reddit groups and clubs all about pens and Iâ€™m not that guy as  I donâ€™t really have much use for a pen and theres always a pen or two in my <span class="invalid-wiki-link">[[Glass Pen Holder]]</span> so I  havenâ€™t had to buy a pen in a long time so these would do in a pinch.</p>

<p>The only other writing tools I may need would be some <span class="invalid-wiki-link">[[Pencils]]</span> and maybe <span class="invalid-wiki-link">[[Sharpie]]</span> or two and I am good to go.</p>
