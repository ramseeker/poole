<p>We fed the sea monkeys  today and it was okay for us and a little fun and I canâ€™t believe that the sea monkeys are actually growing. I thought she was going to jump out of her <a class="wiki-link" href="/2025/11/24/kid-schechers-shoes-with-lights.md/">shoes</a> when she saw the first monkey swimming in the water.</p>

<p>These are a fun little thing and seem to be age appropriate too.</p>

<p>Hereâ€™s a few sea monkeys you can buy if you would like to buy them from Amazon:</p>
