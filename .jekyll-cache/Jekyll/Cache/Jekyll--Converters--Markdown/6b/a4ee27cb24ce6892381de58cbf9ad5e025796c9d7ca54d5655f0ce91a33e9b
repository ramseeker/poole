<p>But, the kiddo loves them more than her <a class="wiki-link" href="/2025/11/22/we-fed-the-sea-monkeys.md/">sea monkeys</a> so thereâ€™s that.</p>

<p>I must warn you that if youâ€™re buying these for your child that they will be clean for all of about 7 seconds. But the good news is that they seem to be washable for the most part and the lights still work after.</p>

<p>Maybe I got lucky with the washing, I dunno but you only get a few month out of these anyway and you can usually find them on sale for about $25 so whatever.</p>

<p>These are great shoes because the child can put them on themselves due to the elastic laces and velcro. I recommend these.</p>

<p>There are other designs and colors if you donâ€™t like my pick, but the skechers are a good brand name sneaker for little growing feet.</p>
