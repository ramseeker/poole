<p>I didn’t know what a trivet was until my late 40’s but now we have them everywhere and they are used almost every day.</p>

<p>What’s a trivet? It’s a thing that allows you to put something hot from the stove and not burn the thing underneath. We use it to serve family style sometimes when we are <span class="invalid-wiki-link">[[2025-12-03-glass-pen-holder.md| glass pen holder]]</span> lazy.</p>
