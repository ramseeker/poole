<p>I used to just use the good old <a href="https://amzn.to/4pKMpf5">j-cloths</a> that I had been using since oh, the eighties at least.</p>

<p>But now, I have better. Because there‚Äôs now some cloths that work better than the old dish washing cloths of yesterday.</p>

<p>The problem with the older dish washing cloths of yesterday is that they smelled a lot if you didn‚Äôt stay on top of them. The musty smell is one smell I could never get used to, and besides - who wants to wash dishes with an older musty dish cloth that‚Äôs a germ factory in fabric farm.</p>

  <p>I really like these because they‚Äôre sturdy but no too big so you‚Äôre not tied up in the cloth while you‚Äôre trying to get some dishes washed</p>

<p>these are great for washing my <a href="http://jims.one/2025/11/24/travel-mug/">travel mug</a> for one example as they are very absorbant to get all the old coffee out and have it rinsed and ready for next time.</p>
