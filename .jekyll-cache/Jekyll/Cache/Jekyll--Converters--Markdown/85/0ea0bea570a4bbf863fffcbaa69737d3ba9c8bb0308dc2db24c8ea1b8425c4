I"œ<p>I only remember using steel wool for cleaning the rust off my bike tires and I doubt I would use it to clean my <a class="wiki-link" href="/2025/12/02/pots-pans.md/">pots and pan set</a> for daily use as there are more gentle <span class="invalid-wiki-link">[[2025-12-02-kitchen-sponge.md|ways]]</span> to clean your dishes now.</p>

<p>I like these over tradition steel wool pads because they donâ€™t have that messy soap built into them already and itâ€™s so, so messy and I have yet to determine if it actually makes a difference so I have to pick the above as my recommendation and just get a bit of your own <a class="wiki-link" href="/2025/12/03/dish-soap.md/">dish soap</a> to use with these pads and I bet youâ€™re rocking it just as well than those others.</p>
