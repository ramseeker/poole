<p>I would be rich if I didnâ€™t have to buy mittens for the child. This, and <a class="wiki-link" href="/2025/12/03/kids-winter-hat.md/">winter hats</a> disappear at an alarming rate.</p>

<p>With this knowledge I suggest that you buy the cheapest winter mittens or gloves you can find.</p>

<p>I like these because theyâ€™re cheap enough and you get 3 pairs for about 5 bucks which isnâ€™t bad at all for kids mittens. You could buy more expensive mittens but why would you when they either get lost or eaten by the Dog?</p>

<p>You could go the route of clips or strings to keep the mittens somehow attatched to the child, but I found they didnâ€™t really work that well and they still got lost.</p>
