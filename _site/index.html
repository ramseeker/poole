<p>The photo of his wife used to occupy the space but he couldn’t bear to look at it now that she was gone.</p>

<p>He was fully aware that one is not supposed to remove photos of loved ones when they passed, but for now the pain was too sharp and piercing.</p>

<p>He fell for her hard on the first day she met, her brown hair fell to her shoulders and when she tucked it behind her ears he knew.</p>

<p>She didn’t know at first. He was a friend and somebody to out with from time to time. Little did she know that he wanted her and to be with her forever.</p>

<p>As time passed, the shared movies became more like dates and although he wasn’t considered a catch in the looks department he was kind, and kind is what she needed.</p>

<p>They had been married 40 years when she died. Cancer, as always. It was slow and horrific as one can imagine but eventually it was just too much and she passed with the winter snow.</p>

<p>The friends and family came and brought lasagna and told him they were sorry for his loss and although they meant well once they were gone the loss was still there and all the well wishes didn’t make a dent.</p>

<p>Perhaps one day the photo would go back into the frame but for now it was empty, just like his heart.</p>

<p>We’ve tried to use some Ugg Boots for the child because they are cute, but nobody really cares what a six-year-old years so this year we cheaped out and got the boots that she picked out.</p>

<p>These ended up being a pretty good buy at about $40 on sale and we like them.</p>

<p><strong>Pros</strong>: Well made, comfortable and easy to put on and off. Waterproof helps too.</p>

<p><strong>Cons</strong>: There’s a chance of premature wear but kids wear through stuff at such a rate it’s not like these will be family heirlooms.</p>

<p><strong>Rating</strong>: 4/3 out of Five Stars.</p>

<p>There’s probably better boots but these are name brand winter boots for kids that are easy to get into and out of, are waterproof and priced usually about $40.00 on sale.</p>

<p>It seems pretty gross to me  to  have to use a handkerchief in 2025 when you have a more palatable option of <a class="wiki-link" href="/facial-tissue">facial tissues</a> because somehow the idea of walking around with a pocket full of boogers isn’t my idea of a good time.</p>

<p>I wonder if there’s a handkerchief reddit group - I’m not going to look - where you can discuss the pros and cons of booger retrieval with handkerchief vs tissues</p>

<p>I would guess there would be.</p>

<p>This photo pretty much sums up the status of winter hats in our house: <strong>lost</strong></p>

<p>That’s why we don’t spend a lot of money on winter hats for the kiddo because what’s the point? I usually just grab the cheapest winter hat I can find and call it a day.</p>

<h3 id="jims-pick-for-winter-hats">Jim’s Pick for Winter Hats</h3>

<p>Here’s a four pack of winter hats for about twelve bucks that would do the trick:</p>

<p>I would be rich if I didn’t have to buy mittens for the child. This, and <a class="wiki-link" href="/2025/12/03/kids-winter-hat.md/">winter hats</a> disappear at an alarming rate.</p>

<p>With this knowledge I suggest that you buy the cheapest winter mittens or gloves you can find.</p>

<p>I like these because they’re cheap enough and you get 3 pairs for about 5 bucks which isn’t bad at all for kids mittens. You could buy more expensive mittens but why would you when they either get lost or eaten by the Dog?</p>

<p>You could go the route of clips or strings to keep the mittens somehow attatched to the child, but I found they didn’t really work that well and they still got lost.</p>

<p>It’s cold and flu season here and that means the tissue consumption goes up because kids and boogers reign supreme here.</p>

<p>These particular tissues are cheap enough at little over one cent per sheet, which isn’t too bad considering that some days this one cent item can seem worth a whole lot more.</p>

<p>I don’t think I could ever get used to using a <span class="invalid-wiki-link">[[2025-12-04-hankerchief.md | hankerchief]]</span>  because then you’re walking <span class="invalid-wiki-link">[[f]]</span> with boogers in your pocket and that’s just gross. ew.</p>

<p><strong>Amazon Facial Tissue Reviews</strong></p>

<p>These particular facial tissues get a pretty good review at 4.3 out of five:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Customers find these facial tissues work well as an everyday product, with good absorbency and value for money. The quality is comparable to Kleenex, and customers appreciate their absorbent 2-ply construction. The softness receives mixed feedback, with some finding them reasonably soft while others describe them as too rough. Durability and thickness are also mixed aspects, with some finding them strong and well-made while others report they tear easily and become thinner over time. The scratchiness is a concern, with customers noting they are rough on the nose.</p>

<p>Sure, there’s other more bougie brands that talk about the <em>craft</em>
 of doing dishes but our job is to get them clean, dry and then use them again hours later usually.</p>

<p><strong>Dawn Platinum Dish Detergent Review</strong></p>

<p><strong>Pros:</strong> Cuts through grease easy and the spray bottle is cool</p>

<p><strong>Cons:</strong> The strong smell can be off-putting to some</p>

<p>For the price, this might just very well be the best soap you can buy for cleaning your dishes - unless, you don’t have kids - then you can use the fancy soap.</p>

<p>I like these over tradition steel wool pads because they don’t have that messy soap built into them already and it’s so, so messy and I have yet to determine if it actually makes a difference so I have to pick the above as my recommendation and just get a bit of your own <a class="wiki-link" href="/2025/12/03/dish-soap.md/">dish soap</a> to use with these pads and I bet you’re rocking it just as well than those others.</p>
