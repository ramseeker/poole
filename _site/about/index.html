  <p>I have no idea what I am writing about most days and if you actually search the <a href="http://jims.one/archive" class="web-link">archive</a>
 you will definitely agree with me.</p>

<p>In fact, I don’t even know what to write here. What I do know is what I want to do is write or have some
 space on the web to hang my shingle so here we are.</p>

<p>I hope to have written more than the few small posts I have written so far here and over time
 I will build an audience. I had thought about using all those newsletters that are popular right now
 like <a href="http://ghost.org" class="web-link">ghost</a> or <a href="http://substack.com" class="web-link">substack</a> but as this is a long term
 project for me that I hope will be for decades I didn’t want to risk tying myself to a platform. heck, that’s one of the reasons why I <a href="https://jimwrites.com/2023/04/22/goodbye-twitter/" class="web-link">quit twitter</a>because even though it’s the internet darling today it might not be tomorrow.</p>

<p>So, I’m using <a href="http://jekyllrb.com" class="web-link">jekyll</a> and <a href="htttp://firebase.com" class="web-link">firebase hosting</a> combined with any
 text editor I find to get my words from my head to the screen. It’s not the most streamlined
 system but for me it works.</p>

<p>I have no grandeur ideas of getting rich with this. Some of these newsletter services make it sound
 so easy: you just press some keys on your keyboard and the money flows out. And for a few, I bet this
 is the case.</p>

<p>I currently use all free services so I’m good with breaking even ;)</p>

<p>The goal is to write. It’s hard to explain but once you get going it almost becomes addictive and
 you can’t stop. The problem I currently have is <a href="https://jimwrites.com/2023/04/23/about-twenty-minutes/" class="web-link">lack of time</a>
 but perhaps when the little one gets a little older I will find more time. Again, this is a long
 term project.  I’m okay with even <strong>one</strong> reader a decade from now.</p>

<p>Anyway, enough.</p>

<p>I’m Jim. I write. Hello.</p>
