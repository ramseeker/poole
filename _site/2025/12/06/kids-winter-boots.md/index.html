  <p>Where we live, winter boots are necessity regardless of age. Well, unless you’re a teen and  then you just wear your Nike’s year round.</p>

It has snowed overnight and I was eager to step outside.  The air was crisp and as I was walking into the snow it felt like walking on fluffy cotton balls.  The snow was still coming down softly and it was truly a winter wonderland.">

<p>We’ve tried to use some Ugg Boots for the child because they are cute, but nobody really cares what a six-year-old years so this year we cheaped out and got the boots that she picked out.</p>

<p><strong>Jim’s Pick for Kid’s Winter Boots</strong></p>

<p><a href="https://amzn.to/48r0LvG" class="web-link">Amazon.com | Lands’ End Waterproof Kids Snow Boots - Insulated Warm Fleece Lined Winter Boots for Toddlers, Girls &amp; Boys - Cotton Candy Pink, 10 Toddler | Boots</a></p>

<p>These ended up being a pretty good buy at about $40 on sale and we like them.</p>

<p><strong>Pros</strong>: Well made, comfortable and easy to put on and off. Waterproof helps too.</p>

<p><strong>Cons</strong>: There’s a chance of premature wear but kids wear through stuff at such a rate it’s not like these will be family heirlooms.</p>

<p><strong>Rating</strong>: 4/3 out of Five Stars.</p>

<p><a href="https://amzn.to/4iJSs1h" class="web-link">Buy Now</a></p>

<p>There’s probably better boots but these are name brand winter boots for kids that are easy to get into and out of, are waterproof and priced usually about $40.00 on sale.</p>
