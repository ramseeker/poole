  <p>He stared at the plain empty frame, and cried.</p>

<p>The photo of his wife used to occupy the space but he couldn’t bear to look at it now that she was gone.</p>

<p>He was fully aware that one is not supposed to remove photos of loved ones when they passed, but for now the pain was too sharp and piercing.</p>

<p>He fell for her hard on the first day she met, her brown hair fell to her shoulders and when she tucked it behind her ears he knew.</p>

<p>She didn’t know at first. He was a friend and somebody to out with from time to time. Little did she know that he wanted her and to be with her forever.</p>

<p>As time passed, the shared movies became more like dates and although he wasn’t considered a catch in the looks department he was kind, and kind is what she needed.</p>

<p>They had been married 40 years when she died. Cancer, as always. It was slow and horrific as one can imagine but eventually it was just too much and she passed with the winter snow.</p>

<p>The friends and family came and brought lasagna and told him they were sorry for his loss and although they meant well once they were gone the loss was still there and all the well wishes didn’t make a dent.</p>

<p>Perhaps one day the photo would go back into the frame but for now it was empty, just like his heart.</p>
