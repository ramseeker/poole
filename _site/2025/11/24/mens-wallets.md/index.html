  <p>Oh, wallets. I’ve had a few in my lifetime but they’ve never seemed to be the one. I had a <a href="https://amzn.to/4oev25n" class="web-link">velcro wallet</a> one once and that was great until you opened it and realized that people were staring.</p>

<p>I always, always wore my wallet that had every receipt in it from 1985 becausse, you never know when you might need it again.</p>

<p>But then I found out about minimalist wallet. I’m no minimalist as <span class="invalid-wiki-link">[[We Have That At Home!| this site]]</span> will show over time but man it’s nice to get this thing into your front pocket instead of the back because it’s a lot easier on the back and you don’t have  take your wallet out after driving for 40 minutes because you can’t feel your  ass anymore.</p>

<p>If my pick doesn’t do it for you there’s a few other wallets that might work and are still minimal:</p>
