<p>Actually, scratch that. Pots and pans <strong>do matter</strong> because if you eat at home (you should) then you will spend a lot of time cooking and liek th mechanics that pay a lot of money for good tools, every home should have a good pot and pan set.</p>

<p><strong>Jim’s Pick for Blue Coffee Mugs</strong></p>

</blockquote>

<p>This is a really nice mug. It holds a good amount of coffee or whatever hot drink you want to have. I sometimes am able to get a latte in this mug without issue.</p>

<p>This blue coffee mug had a good hand feel in the hand and seems to work well for me for using every day. They are sturdy and are dishwasher safe which is nice too because nobody wants to wash dishes by hand with a <span class="invalid-wiki-link">[[2025-12-02-kitchen-sponge.md|kitchen sponge]]</span> because that’s no fun.</p>

<p>But now, I have better. Because there’s now some cloths that work better than the old dish washing cloths of yesterday.</p>

<p>The problem with the older dish washing cloths of yesterday is that they smelled a lot if you didn’t stay on top of them. The musty smell is one smell I could never get used to, and besides - who wants to wash dishes with an older musty dish cloth that’s a germ factory in fabric farm.</p>

<p>these are great for washing my <a href="http://jims.one/2025/11/24/travel-mug/" class="web-link">travel mug</a> for one example as they are very absorbant to get all the old coffee out and have it rinsed and ready for next time.</p>

<p>Now, especially because now they’re not just plain denim but also some kind of space age stretchy material for those of us with variable waistlines.</p>

<p>I stick to the basic colors and for style, I like the slim fit for my once slim fit, but if I keep eating pie I might have to graduate to relaxed</p>

<p>I suggest waiting for them to go on sale as they tend to frequently because who wants to pay full price for a pair of jeans?</p>

You would think with all this technology available to is we would be able to design a coffee mug that doesn’t spill. 
I didn’t know I was a coffee cup snob until I was constantly spilling on myself and so I went and did some reading and found that the Contigo cups were pretty good.</p>

<p>I like the fact that you can flip a tab and the opening will close quickly as you don’t have to worry about spilling. 
I would and definitely have recommend this coffee travel mug.</p>

    <p>Oh, wallets. I’ve had a few in my lifetime but they’ve never seemed to be the one. I had a <a href="https://amzn.to/4oev25n" class="web-link">velcro wallet</a> one once and that was great until you opened it and realized that people were staring.</p>

<p>I always, always wore my wallet that had every receipt in it from 1985 becausse, you never know when you might need it again.</p>

<p>But then I found out about minimalist wallet. I’m no minimalist as <span class="invalid-wiki-link">[[We Have That At Home!| this site]]</span> will show over time but man it’s nice to get this thing into your front pocket instead of the back because it’s a lot easier on the back and you don’t have  take your wallet out after driving for 40 minutes because you can’t feel your  ass anymore.</p>

    <p>I really don’t care much for what winter coat I have as my current lifestyle is to go from house to car most days and <strong>maybe</strong> have to stand around and wait for the school bus with my daughter in the am.</p>

<p>I have the Amazon essentials puffer jacket and one of the better features of this jacket is that it is cheap and is often on sale for $20 or so which in 2025 is a great price for a jacket of any kind.</p>

<p>There’s other jackets you could buy and some are from brands you recognize and then some are from brands you don’t but they are all the same fairly well so just pick one. I like the Amazon one I list above, but if that’s not your bag, then there’s others to choose from.</p>

<p>But, the kiddo loves them more than her <a class="wiki-link" href="/2025/11/22/we-fed-the-sea-monkeys.md/">sea monkeys</a> so there’s that.</p>

<p>I must warn you that if you’re buying these for your child that they will be clean for all of about 7 seconds. But the good news is that they seem to be washable for the most part and the lights still work after.</p>

<p>Maybe I got lucky with the washing, I dunno but you only get a few month out of these anyway and you can usually find them on sale for about $25 so whatever.</p>

<p>These are great shoes because the child can put them on themselves due to the elastic laces and velcro. I recommend these.</p>

<p>There are other designs and colors if you don’t like my pick, but the skechers are a good brand name sneaker for little growing feet.</p>
