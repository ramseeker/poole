    <p>I was not sold on this broom when we got it - not because it’s pink but because I thought the bristles were a bit stiff compared to my previous broom set.</p>

<p>It turns out I was wrong.</p>

<p>After using this  broom for a few days, you get used to it - like anything else - and for the money I paid for this broom and dustpan set, it’s fine.</p>

<p><strong>Jim’s Pick for Pink Broom and Dustpan</strong></p>

<p>I like this one due to the stuff brushes and the dustpan itself has some bristles that you can use to make sure all the dog hair stays in the pan and doesn’t just get moved around the bristles of the broom.</p>

<p><strong>Pros</strong>: Well made and the pet hair teeth are great</p>

<p><strong>Cons</strong>: the handle keeps coming unscrewed</p>

<p><strong>Rating</strong>: 4.4 out of five</p>

<p>I hate zippered wallets, as to me they seem like another step to have to do at the counter when you need to pay so I don’t really understand the need, just like I have no reason to buy a <a href="https://amzn.to/4aHmlxa" class="web-link">wallet phone case</a> as that seems like a bad idea too.</p>

<p>That said, here’s the wallet I would buy:</p>

<p><strong>Jim’s Pick for a Women’s Zippered Wallet</strong>
<a href="https://amzn.to/3MEFupD" class="web-link">Michael Kors Women’s Jet Set Double Zip Wristlet, Gold-Tone Hardware/Soft Pink: Handbags: Amazon.com</a></p>

<p>This wallet by Michael Kors looks to be a lot nicer than the weirdly-named off brand wallets you can buy and it seems to hold all things you would need such as a phone and cards and ID so I don’t know what else you would need from a small wallet for women.</p>

<p><strong>Pros:</strong> Excellent quality and well worth the price</p>

<p><strong>Cons:</strong> The phone slot could be a bit too tight for larger phones</p>

<p><strong>Rating:</strong> 4.7 out of 5</p>

<p><strong>Alternative Choice</strong>
<a href="https://amzn.to/48KYzhn" class="web-link">Amazon.com: Travelambo Womens Wallet Tassel Bifold Ladies Clutch Wristlet Wrist strap Long Purse (Access Green Blooming) : Clothing, Shoes &amp; Jewelry</a></p>

<p>Despite the weird name, the Travelambo Women’s wallet is a fraction of the price and is a good choice for those budget minded.</p>

<p>These little pens are not a piece of crap like a lot of other pens you can buy. Sure, they are not the cheapest pen you can buy in 2025 but they’re close and if my daughter would stay out of our junk drawer we might even have one when I went looking for a pen.</p>

<p><strong>Pros:</strong> A writing experience comparable to pricier options</p>

<p>Her bad decisions. She didn’t go to college when all her friends did. She bought a car and got a good factory job. “Not everyone needs to go to college”, she told herself.</p>

<p>And for a while, she was right. She had the house and the fancy truck and all the trappings of the upper middle class. Her boots - her boots even screamed “I’ve made it”</p>

<p>Then the layoff notices came. Restructuring, they said.</p>

<p>The truck went first. She missed it, but it was a toy and  there were other options including public transit. “It’s not that bad”, she lied to herself.</p>

<p>Her friends were still there - the college-going friends. The ones that had “careers” and not just well paying jobs. But they didn’t have what she had - determination.</p>

<p>She sold some belongings on eBay and Craigslist and scraped up enough to buy a mop and broom and other cleaning supplies. For the first few jobs, this will have to do - and they did. She cleaned well and she cleaned fast and those 2 traits got her more and more referrals until one day she realized she didn’t want the house cleaner as she was the cleaner and she was fine with that.</p>

<p>The economy may still be bad, but she was doing great.</p>

<p>The photo of his wife used to occupy the space but he couldn’t bear to look at it now that she was gone.</p>

<p>He was fully aware that one is not supposed to remove photos of loved ones when they passed, but for now the pain was too sharp and piercing.</p>

<p>He fell for her hard on the first day she met, her brown hair fell to her shoulders and when she tucked it behind her ears he knew.</p>

<p>She didn’t know at first. He was a friend and somebody to out with from time to time. Little did she know that he wanted her and to be with her forever.</p>

<p>As time passed, the shared movies became more like dates and although he wasn’t considered a catch in the looks department he was kind, and kind is what she needed.</p>

<p>They had been married 40 years when she died. Cancer, as always. It was slow and horrific as one can imagine but eventually it was just too much and she passed with the winter snow.</p>

<p>The friends and family came and brought lasagna and told him they were sorry for his loss and although they meant well once they were gone the loss was still there and all the well wishes didn’t make a dent.</p>

<p>Perhaps one day the photo would go back into the frame but for now it was empty, just like his heart.</p>

<p><strong>Pros</strong>: Well made, comfortable and easy to put on and off. Waterproof helps too.</p>

<p>This photo pretty much sums up the status of winter hats in our house: <strong>lost</strong></p>

<p>That’s why we don’t spend a lot of money on winter hats for the kiddo because what’s the point? I usually just grab the cheapest winter hat I can find and call it a day.</p>

<h3 id="jims-pick-for-winter-hats">Jim’s Pick for Winter Hats</h3>

<p>Here’s a four pack of winter hats for about twelve bucks that would do the trick:</p>

<p>There is absolutely no sense in buying anything greater unless the conditions are really cold and you then you should just keep the kiddos inside anyway and have them watch movies on their <a class="wiki-link" href="/kids-amazon-tablet.md/">tablet</a></p>

<p>I would be rich if I didn’t have to buy mittens for the child. This, and <a class="wiki-link" href="/kids-winter-hat.md/">winter hats</a> disappear at an alarming rate.</p>

<p>With this knowledge I suggest that you buy the cheapest winter mittens or gloves you can find.</p>

<p>I like these because they’re cheap enough and you get 3 pairs for about 5 bucks which isn’t bad at all for kids mittens. You could buy more expensive mittens but why would you when they either get lost or eaten by the Dog?</p>

<p>You could go the route of clips or strings to keep the mittens somehow attatched to the child, but I found they didn’t really work that well and they still got lost.</p>
