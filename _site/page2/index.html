<p>It’s cold and flu season here and that means the tissue consumption goes up because kids and boogers reign supreme here.</p>

<p>These particular tissues are cheap enough at little over one cent per sheet, which isn’t too bad considering that some days this one cent item can seem worth a whole lot more.</p>

<p>I don’t think I could ever get used to using a <span class="invalid-wiki-link">[[2025-12-04-hankerchief.md | hankerchief]]</span>  because then you’re walking <span class="invalid-wiki-link">[[f]]</span> with boogers in your pocket and that’s just gross. ew.</p>

<p><strong>Amazon Facial Tissue Reviews</strong></p>

<p>These particular facial tissues get a pretty good review at 4.3 out of five:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Customers find these facial tissues work well as an everyday product, with good absorbency and value for money. The quality is comparable to Kleenex, and customers appreciate their absorbent 2-ply construction. The softness receives mixed feedback, with some finding them reasonably soft while others describe them as too rough. Durability and thickness are also mixed aspects, with some finding them strong and well-made while others report they tear easily and become thinner over time. The scratchiness is a concern, with customers noting they are rough on the nose.</p>

    <p>Dish Soap. I used to just buy whatever was on sale and not think about it, but then I got married and for a while we are using Mrs.Meyers dishsoap but that shit got expensive in a hurry once we had a kid.</p>

<p>So, now we just buy the <a href="https://amzn.to/4pNFbXV" class="web-link">cheapest dish detergent</a> we can find and lately it’s been this one:</p>

<p>Sure, there’s other more bougie brands that talk about the <em>craft</em>
 of doing dishes but our job is to get them clean, dry and then use them again hours later usually.</p>

<p><strong>Dawn Platinum Dish Detergent Review</strong></p>

<p><strong>Pros:</strong> Cuts through grease easy and the spray bottle is cool</p>

<p><strong>Cons:</strong> The strong smell can be off-putting to some</p>

<p><strong>Rating:</strong> 4.8 stars</p>

<p><strong><a href="https://amzn.to/48whPin" class="web-link">Add to Cart</a></strong></p>

<p>For the price, this might just very well be the best soap you can buy for cleaning your dishes - unless, you don’t have kids - then you can use the fancy soap.</p>

<p>Actually, scratch that. Pots and pans <strong>do matter</strong> because if you eat at home (you should) then you will spend a lot of time cooking and liek th mechanics that pay a lot of money for good tools, every home should have a good pot and pan set.</p>

</blockquote>

<p>This is a really nice mug. It holds a good amount of coffee or whatever hot drink you want to have. I sometimes am able to get a latte in this mug without issue.</p>

<p>This blue coffee mug had a good hand feel in the hand and seems to work well for me for using every day. They are sturdy and are dishwasher safe which is nice too because nobody wants to wash dishes by hand with a <span class="invalid-wiki-link">[[2025-12-02-kitchen-sponge.md|kitchen sponge]]</span> because that’s no fun.</p>

<p>But now, I have better. Because there’s now some cloths that work better than the old dish washing cloths of yesterday.</p>

<p>The problem with the older dish washing cloths of yesterday is that they smelled a lot if you didn’t stay on top of them. The musty smell is one smell I could never get used to, and besides - who wants to wash dishes with an older musty dish cloth that’s a germ factory in fabric farm.</p>

<p>Now, especially because now they’re not just plain denim but also some kind of space age stretchy material for those of us with variable waistlines.</p>

<p>I stick to the basic colors and for style, I like the slim fit for my once slim fit, but if I keep eating pie I might have to graduate to relaxed</p>

<p>I suggest waiting for them to go on sale as they tend to frequently because who wants to pay full price for a pair of jeans?</p>

You would think with all this technology available to is we would be able to design a coffee mug that doesn’t spill. 
I didn’t know I was a coffee cup snob until I was constantly spilling on myself and so I went and did some reading and found that the Contigo cups were pretty good.</p>

<p>I like the fact that you can flip a tab and the opening will close quickly as you don’t have to worry about spilling. 
I would and definitely have recommend this coffee travel mug.</p>
