You would think with all this technology available to is we would be able to design a coffee mug that doesn’t spill. 
I didn’t know I was a coffee cup snob until I was constantly spilling on myself and so I went and did some reading and found that the Contigo cups were pretty good.</p>

<p>I like the fact that you can flip a tab and the opening will close quickly as you don’t have to worry about spilling. 
I would and definitely have recommend this coffee travel mug.</p>

    <p>Oh, wallets. I’ve had a few in my lifetime but they’ve never seemed to be the one. I had a <a href="https://amzn.to/4oev25n" class="web-link">velcro wallet</a> one once and that was great until you opened it and realized that people were staring.</p>

<p>I always, always wore my wallet that had every receipt in it from 1985 becausse, you never know when you might need it again.</p>

<p>But then I found out about minimalist wallet. I’m no minimalist as <span class="invalid-wiki-link">[[We Have That At Home!| this site]]</span> will show over time but man it’s nice to get this thing into your front pocket instead of the back because it’s a lot easier on the back and you don’t have  take your wallet out after driving for 40 minutes because you can’t feel your  ass anymore.</p>

<p>If my pick doesn’t do it for you there’s a few other wallets that might work and are still minimal:</p>

    <p>I really don’t care much for what winter coat I have as my current lifestyle is to go from house to car most days and <strong>maybe</strong> have to stand around and wait for the school bus with my daughter in the am.</p>

<p><span class="embed-image-wrapper"><img class="embed-image" src="/assets/Pasted%20image%2020251130164107.png"></span></p>
<p>I have the Amazon essentials puffer jacket and one of the better features of this jacket is that it is cheap and is often on sale for $20 or so which in 2025 is a great price for a jacket of any kind.</p>

<p>There’s other jackets you could buy and some are from brands you recognize and then some are from brands you don’t but they are all the same fairly well so just pick one. I like the Amazon one I list above, but if that’s not your bag, then there’s others to choose from.</p>

<p>But, the kiddo loves them more than her <a class="wiki-link" href="/2025/11/22/we-fed-the-sea-monkeys.md/">sea monkeys</a> so there’s that.</p>

<p>I must warn you that if you’re buying these for your child that they will be clean for all of about 7 seconds. But the good news is that they seem to be washable for the most part and the lights still work after.</p>

<p>Maybe I got lucky with the washing, I dunno but you only get a few month out of these anyway and you can usually find them on sale for about $25 so whatever.</p>

<p>These are great shoes because the child can put them on themselves due to the elastic laces and velcro. I recommend these.</p>

<p>There are other designs and colors if you don’t like my pick, but the skechers are a good brand name sneaker for little growing feet.</p>

<p>We fed the sea monkeys  today and it was okay for us and a little fun and I can’t believe that the sea monkeys are actually growing. I thought she was going to jump out of her <a class="wiki-link" href="/2025/11/24/kid-schechers-shoes-with-lights.md/">shoes</a> when she saw the first monkey swimming in the water.</p>

<p>These are a fun little thing and seem to be age appropriate too.</p>

<p>Here’s a few sea monkeys you can buy if you would like to buy them from Amazon:</p>

<p><img src="/assets/corktrivet.png" alt="cork trivets"></p>

<p>I didn’t know what a trivet was until my late 40’s but now we have them everywhere and they are used almost every day.</p>

<p>What’s a trivet? It’s a thing that allows you to put something hot from the stove and not burn the thing underneath. We use it to serve family style sometimes when we are <span class="invalid-wiki-link">[[2025-12-03-glass-pen-holder.md| glass pen holder]]</span> lazy.</p>

<h2 id="jims-pick">Jim’s Pick</h2>
<p>I’m not that fussy about trivets and so I <a class="wiki-link" href="/2025/11/21/Trivets.md/"> Trivets</a> just get some cork trivets like these and call it a day:</p>

  <h3 id="jims-pick">Jim’s Pick</h3>

  <p>If I had to pick one hoodie, it would be this one because, I would like to have <strong>no logo at all</strong> but I am the odd one and this is the best it gets then it’s this one:</p>

  <p><a href="https://amzn.to/4rdE9G3" class="web-link">adidas Men’s Essentials Fleece Hoodie, Shadow Brown, Small at Amazon Men’s Clothing store</a></p>
</blockquote>

<p>All you really need is a clean hoodie a white t-shirt underneath and some comfortable shoes and you’re ready to go.</p>

<p>I’m kind of allergic to logos, but the Adidas stuff is well made for the most part so that’s why I would buy this one over others, but there’s a few other options to consider when buying the best hooded sweatshirt for your wardrobe</p>

<p>Also worth considering:</p>
