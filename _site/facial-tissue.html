<p><strong>Jim’s Pick for Facial Tissues</strong></p>
<blockquote>
  <p><a href="https://amzn.to/4rAMG6j" class="web-link">Amazon Basics Facial Tissue</a></p>
</blockquote>

<p>It’s cold and flu season here and that means the tissue consumption goes up because kids and boogers reign supreme here.</p>

<p>These particular tissues are cheap enough at little over one cent per sheet, which isn’t too bad considering that some days this one cent item can seem worth a whole lot more.</p>

<p>I don’t think I could ever get used to using a <span class="invalid-wiki-link">[[2025-12-04-hankerchief.md | hankerchief]]</span>  because then you’re walking <span class="invalid-wiki-link">[[f]]</span> with boogers in your pocket and that’s just gross. ew.</p>

<p><strong>Amazon Facial Tissue Reviews</strong></p>

<p>These particular facial tissues get a pretty good review at 4.3 out of five:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Customers find these facial tissues work well as an everyday product, with good absorbency and value for money. The quality is comparable to Kleenex, and customers appreciate their absorbent 2-ply construction. The softness receives mixed feedback, with some finding them reasonably soft while others describe them as too rough. Durability and thickness are also mixed aspects, with some finding them strong and well-made while others report they tear easily and become thinner over time. The scratchiness is a concern, with customers noting they are rough on the nose.</p>
